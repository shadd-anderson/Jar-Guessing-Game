# Jar-Guessing-Game

Welcome to the jar game! This is like a digital version of those "Guess how many are in the jar" games.
The jar requires two things: an item to be put in it, and a max amount to put in the jar.
A new, random jar will be produced every game, with any number of items between 1 and the max number specified in the jar. So for instance, if you specify the max amount to be 300, the jar will generate a random number anywhere from 1 - 300.
Your job is to guess how much is in the jar in the least amount of guesses. Good luck!
